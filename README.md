# Precipitation-Analysis
>Analysis Dane County Area Precipitation with Statistics Modeling and ML using PCA, Python, Scikit learn NumPy and Pandas

## Introduction

>Precipitation is any product of water that falls under gravitational pull from clouds. Our goal in this project is to find out which factors determine the probability of rain. This prediction might help to figure out which factors have most relate to precipitation

## Conclusion

Based on statistical analysis, we identified factors that affect precipitation. We can find more theoretically accurate correlations through meteorology, but with these statistical analyses and observational data, without specific scientific knowledge, we can find meaningful correlations. We have identified that temperature, dew point, and wind speed affect precipitation. Using weather information and three elements will help us intuitively determine whether rain or not
